## 🚀 **How to Use This Implementation**

### **Step 1: Review Current Implementation**
```bash

const handleStartExam = async () => {
  const manager = new AutoFullscreenManager();
  const result = await manager.initializeSecureExam(examId, studentId, authToken);
  
  if (result.success) {
    // Exam started in automatic fullscreen mode!
    setExamStarted(true);
  }
};
```

### **Step 4: Test the Implementation**

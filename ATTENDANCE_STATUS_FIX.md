# Exam Attendance Status Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix issues with the exam attendance status tracking and reporting.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Status Inconsistency**: The system was not properly reporting IN_PROGRESS status for exam attendances.
2. **Attempt Number Tracking**: Some attendance records were missing attempt numbers.
3. **Stale IN_PROGRESS Records**: Old IN_PROGRESS records were not being properly updated to TIMED_OUT status.
4. **Variable Name Conflict**: Fixed a SyntaxError where the variable `nextAttemptNumber` was declared twice in the same scope.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Attendance Utilities (utils/attendanceUtils.js)

Created a dedicated utility module with the following functions:
- `getStatusDisplay`: Returns user-friendly status display text
- `cleanupStaleAttendances`: Automatically updates stale IN_PROGRESS records to TIMED_OUT
- `fixAttemptNumbers`: Fixes inconsistent attempt numbering
- `getNextAttemptNumber`: Calculates the correct next attempt number
- `getDetailedStatus`: Returns complete status information including inProgress flag

### 2. Updated Controllers

**Exam Attendance Controller**:
- Now uses utility functions for status determination and attempt numbering
- Added automatic cleanup of stale attendances
- Fixed variable name conflicts by using different variable names for same-scope declarations

**Exams Controller**:
- Updated status checking to use the new utility functions
- Now properly tracks attempt numbers when creating new attendances

### 3. Added Scheduled Cleanup

Added a periodic task in app.js to automatically clean up stale attendances every 30 minutes.

### 4. Created Fix Scripts

**fix_attendance_status.js**:
- One-time fix for existing data
- Updates inconsistent records
- Fixes missing attempt numbers
- Converts stale IN_PROGRESS records to TIMED_OUT

**verify_status.js**:
- Validates that the status utilities are working correctly
- Confirms inProgress flag is correctly set

## Testing

The fixes have been tested and verified to work. The system now:
1. Correctly reports exam status as IN_PROGRESS when appropriate
2. Properly tracks attempt numbers
3. Automatically cleans up stale records
4. Shows correct inProgress flag in the frontend
5. Successfully starts without any syntax errors

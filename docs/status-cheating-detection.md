# Cheating Detection Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `examAttendance.model.js` with new fields for cheating detection:
  - Added `cheatDetected` boolean field
  - Added `cheatEvidence` array for storing evidence details
  - Added `flaggedForReview` field for administrative review
- [x] Added controller functions in `examAttendance.controller.js`:
  - Implemented `reportCheating` function for client-side reporting
  - Implemented `getCheatingReports` function for admin access to reports
- [x] Added API routes in `examAttendance.routes.js`:
  - Created POST route for `/api/exam-attendance/:examId/report-cheating`
  - Created GET route for `/api/exam-attendance/admin/:examId/cheating-reports`
- [x] Created test script for verifying functionality
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement client-side detection mechanisms in the frontend
- [ ] Create admin dashboard UI components for reviewing cheating reports
- [ ] Implement server-side detection algorithms for pattern analysis
- [ ] Add notification system for administrators
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Create automated flagging system based on severity thresholds

## Technical Debt
- Need to consider database performance with large evidence collections
- Consider adding pagination for the cheating reports API
- Add more robust validation for evidence data

## Next Steps
1. Integrate with frontend components
2. Implement basic client-side detection for tab switching and copy-paste events
3. Create simple admin view for reviewing flagged exams
4. Test with real exam scenarios

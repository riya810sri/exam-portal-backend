# Report Cheating Endpoint Enhancements

## Issue Fixed
The system was returning a 404 "No active exam found to report cheating" error when users attempted to report cheating incidents but didn't have an active exam with "IN_PROGRESS" status.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced the `reportCheating` Controller
Modified the controller to be more flexible in handling cheating reports by:
- First attempting to find an in-progress exam
- If not found, looking for the most recent exam attendance record for the user/exam
- As a last resort, creating a new record with "SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY" status to store the evidence

### 2. Removed Restrictive Middleware
Removed the `blockPostman` middleware from the report-cheating endpoint to allow legitimate client-side reports.

### 3. Added Anti-Abuse Data Collection
Ensured the `collectAntiAbuseData` middleware is used to gather additional context for security analysis.

## Benefits
1. Frontend cheating detection will now work properly even when:
   - The user's exam has completed but suspicious activity is still detected
   - The user attempts to access exam content without an active session
   - The user switches between tabs after completing an exam

2. Security logs are more comprehensive, tracking suspicious activity even outside active exam sessions

3. Admin review capabilities are enhanced with more complete evidence collection

## Recommended Frontend Changes
None required. The frontend can continue to use the same API endpoint without modifications.

## Testing
The endpoint can be tested with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exam-attendance/683430d16db3c277cd1b0ded/report-cheating \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3001" \
  --data-raw '{"evidenceType":"TAB_SWITCH","details":{"switchCount":1,"hiddenTime":15,"visibilityState":"hidden"}}'
```

The endpoint should now return a 200 success response even without an active exam.

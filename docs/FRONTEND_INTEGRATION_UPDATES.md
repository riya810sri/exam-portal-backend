# Exam Portal Frontend Integration Changes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Report Cheating Endpoint

The `report-cheating` endpoint now works correctly in all scenarios, including when:
- The user has no active exam session
- The exam has already been completed
- The user is reviewing past exams

**Previous Error:**
```
Error: No active exam found to report cheating
```

**Solution:**
The backend now handles cheating reports more intelligently:
- First tries to find an in-progress exam
- If not found, looks for any exam attendance record for the user
- As a last resort, creates a placeholder record to store the evidence

### 2. Start Monitoring Endpoint

Added support for both URL formats:
- `/api/exam-attendance/:examId/start-monitoring`
- `/api/exam-attendance/start-monitoring/:examId`

This ensures compatibility with different frontend implementations.

## Complete API Flow Documentation

A comprehensive API flow documentation has been created at:
`/save_data/abhi/Projects/exam_portal_backend/docs/EXAM_ATTENDANCE_API_FLOW.md`

This document provides:
- Complete request/response examples for all exam-related endpoints
- Authentication flow details
- Error handling patterns
- Implementation examples for frontend code

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. No changes are required to existing frontend code - both endpoints now work with the current implementation
2. Refer to the API flow documentation for additional features that can be implemented
3. The backend now captures security incidents more comprehensively, enhancing the overall security posture

## Testing the Fixed Endpoints

You can test the fixed endpoints with:

```bash
# Report cheating (works in all scenarios now)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exam-attendance/683430d16db3c277cd1b0ded/report-cheating \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3001" \
  --data-raw '{"evidenceType":"TAB_SWITCH","details":{"switchCount":1,"hiddenTime":15,"visibilityState":"hidden"}}'

# Start monitoring (both URL formats work)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exam-attendance/683430d16db3c277cd1b0ded/start-monitoring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3001" \
  --data-raw '{"userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0","screenResolution":"1920x1080","timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","browserFingerprint":{}}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exam-attendance/start-monitoring/683430d16db3c277cd1b0ded \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3001" \
  --data-raw '{"userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0","screenResolution":"1920x1080","timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","browserFingerprint":{}}'
```
